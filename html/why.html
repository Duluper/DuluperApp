    <h1>Why did I make this app?</h1> <br>
    <p><b>This is my personal app called Duluper, it was originally just for getting to my socials quickly but now its just my own app that I can use however I like (and distribute it to anyone I like)</b></p> <br>
    <p>One of two reasons you read that paragraph:</p>
    <li>You are one of my friends that I distributed this app to</li>
    <li>You are someone just interested in this app (eg: Relatives)</li>
    <button id="GoBackBtn">Go back</button>
